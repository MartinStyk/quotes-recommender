"My parents, and librarians along the way, taught me about the space between words; about the margins, where so many juicy moments of life and spirit and friendship could be found.

"I used to pre-rehearse everything and then bring my pre-rehearsed performance to the set. Now, I'm learning to let it happen in the moment. American actors are much better at that than British actors. If I knew how to trust myself, I would have been much more relaxed. Maybe I would have less gray hairs today.","Hugh Grant","Trust,Today,Myself"
"I think about food all the time. It's my passion; it's my profession. But some people think about food all the time because they're hungry. We can put an end to this if we join forces and lend a hand.","Cat Cora","Food,End"

"Music is the fourth great material want, first food, then clothes, then shelter, then music.","Christian Nestell Bovee","Music,Great,Want"
"Kids don't need to be taught the value of making; they are natural makers, at least until traditional education makes them afraid of making mistakes.

"There is a huge difference between failing and failure. Failing is trying something that you learn doesn't work. Failure is throwing in the towel and giving up. True success comes from failing repeatedly and as quickly as possible, before your cash or your willpower runs out.","Jay Samit","Success,Giving"
"Most small business owners are not particularly sophisticated business people. That's not a criticism; they're passionate about cutting hair or cooking food, and that's why they got in the business, not because they have an MBA.","Andrew Mason","Business,People"

"Food is everything. Food, friends, family: Those are the most important things in life.","Zac Posen","Family,Friends"

"First and foremost I am a chef, whether behind the stove at one of my Northern California restaurants or for the past 15 years in front of the camera on my Food Network cooking shows.

"If you've gone into a marriage and you haven't been clear about how you're going to handle money, how you want to raise kids, who is going to work or stay home or what have you, then you've set yourself up for failure.","Phil McGraw","Work,Home"

"I remember once in junior high school, on a Friday, my mom came home from work and said to my brother and I, 'You know, between us, we have only 27 cents, but we have food in the refrigerator, we have our little garden out back, and we're happy, so we are rich.'","John Paul DeJoria","Home,Happy"

"Success has nothing to do with what you gain in life or accomplish for yourself. It's what you do for others.","Danny Thomas","Success,Yourself"
"If you truly get in touch with a piece of carrot, you get in touch with the soil, the rain, the sunshine.

If we chew every morsel of our food in that way we become grateful and when you are grateful, you are happy.","Thich Nhat Hanh","Happy,Mother"

Or are you making movies to learn something?'","Kristen Stewart","Love,Home"
"Show me a thoroughly satisfied man and I will show you a failure.","Thomas A. Edison","Man,Me"

"You want to put out a TV show? If you have the money to do it on your own, by yourself, and you have a TV network, you can do it by yourself. But the nature of the beast is, art needs finance.

"Money doesn't mean anything to me. I've made a lot of money, but I want to enjoy life and not stress myself building my bank account. I give lots away and live simply, mostly out of a suitcase in hotels. We all know that good health is much more important.","Keanu Reeves","Health,Money"
"What works for men does not always work for women, because success and likability are positively correlated for men and negatively correlated for women. That's what the research shows.

"I deeply believe that marriage is by nature between a man and a woman, but that conviction does not prevent me from recognising that other forms of affective relationships exist.","Sebastian Pinera","Nature,Woman"

"Today when I think about diversity, I actually think about the word 'inclusion.' And I think this is a time of great inclusion. It's not men, it's not women alone.

"For me, personally, marriage is a man and a woman living together.","Angela Merkel","Together,Woman"
"The fact that what we believe about marriage - that it should be between a man and a woman - and that we're pro-life, somehow that becomes radical? Why is that? It's because our culture has changed.

"I don't think it ever does any harm in any business to feel that there is someone there who cares about it. If you look at any business, fashion being the most obvious, the aura, or the reality of the designer, is part of what creates it. It's true in luxury goods stores and in good food stores. It leaves a palpable sense that someone cares.","Andre Balazs","Food,Business,Good Food"

"In a basic sense, 'A Little Life' is a homage to how my friends and I live our lives. I wanted to push past the definitions of how we typically define friendship.

And hit 'em hard.","Jeff Ross","Friendship,Work,Respect"
"As far as an actor-director connection, I think those can develop, and when they do, they're really great, and you just cultivate it like you would any relationship or friendship.

I try and really respect that voice and not abuse it.","Jesse Tyler Ferguson","Marriage,Work,Hope"

"Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement, is the holy of holies of Jewish time. It is that rarest of phenomena, a Jewish festival without food.

"Some argue that now isn't the time to push the green agenda - that all efforts should be on preventing a serious recession. That is a false choice.
