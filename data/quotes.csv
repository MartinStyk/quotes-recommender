"I teach students that what people say about failure in politics is mostly wrong. People always told me, 'They'll praise you on your way up and kick you on your way down.' That wasn't my experience.

"I used to pre-rehearse everything and then bring my pre-rehearsed performance to the set. Now, I'm learning to let it happen in the moment.

"A man cannot be said to succeed in this life who does not satisfy one friend.","Henry David Thoreau","Friendship,Life,Man,Friend"
"The objectification of females is not a good thing! Not every rapper does this, but when the lyrics focus solely on the strip club, 'poppin' bottles' and how many girls they can 'tap,' it distorts what kids are learning. I think if there was more of a female presence in hip hop we could break up the monotony. It's all about balance.","Queen Latifah","Learning,Good,Focus,Balance"

"And the thing about me is, I have a lot of mellow songs, because they're the easiest for me to write. I wanted to try to make some more upbeat songs, so, I ended up gravitating toward writing songs with friends, which was a great learning process, and also we came up with great songs. Those are the songs that came out the most naturally.","Priscilla Ahn","Learning,Friends,Great,Writing"

"What's disgusting about genetic modification of food? I speculate that many people have an immediate, intuitive sense that what's healthy is what's 'natural,' and that efforts to tamper with nature will inevitably unleash serious risks - so-called Frankenfoods. The problem with that speculation is that it's flat-out wrong.","Cass Sunstein","Food,Nature,Problem,People"

"I used to define success as being able to produce any result you wanted, whether it was a relationship, weight-loss, being a millionaire, impacting the culture, changing society, whatever it might be - it might be homelessness, whatever - and lately, I've redefined success as 'fulfilling your soul's purpose.'","Jack Canfield","Success,Relationship,Culture"

"In 1977, when I started my first job at the Federal Reserve Board as a staff economist in the Division of International Finance, it was an article of faith in central banking that secrecy about monetary policy decisions was the best policy: Central banks, as a rule, did not discuss these decisions, let alone their future policy intentions.","Janet Yellen","Finance,Faith,Future,Best"

"Marriage is almost as old as dirt, and it was defined in the garden between Adam and Eve. One man, one woman for life till death do you part. So I would never attempt to try to redefine marriage. And I don't think anyone else should either. So do I support the idea of gay marriage? No, I don't.","Kirk Cameron","Marriage,Life,Death,Man"

Get a second opinion.","Nick Vujicic","Life,Love,Good,Humor"
"I love fairy tales because of their haunting beauty and magical strangeness. They are set in worlds where anything can happen. Frogs can be kings, a thicket of brambles can hide a castle where a royal court has lain asleep for a hundred years, a boy can outwit a giant, and a girl can break a curse with nothing but her courage and steadfastness.","Kate Forsyth","Love,Beauty,Courage,Girl"
"I believe the reason we sleep is not just to allow our body to rest but that it is to allow this inner wisdom to speak to us through symbols.

"When we honestly ask ourselves which person in our lives means the most to us, we often find that it is those who, instead of giving advice, solutions, or cures, have chosen rather to share our pain and touch our wounds with a warm and tender hand.","Henri Nouwen","Friendship,Pain,Advice,Giving"
"I work really hard at trying to see the big picture and not getting stuck in ego. I believe we're all put on this planet for a purpose, and we all have a different purpose...

"I've seen zero evidence of any nation on Earth other than Mexico even remotely having the slightest clue what Mexican food is about or even come close to reproducing it. It is perhaps the most misunderstood country and cuisine on Earth.","Anthony Bourdain","Food,Earth,Mexican,Mexico"

"I mean, I love L.A. - I love living here. But I wish that we could make things without the need to hit a home run every single time.

Or are you making movies to learn something?'","Kristen Stewart","Failure,Love,Time,Home"

"My husband wrote me love letters while I was on location in Canada and pregnant. They turned into being about food, and it turned it into a cookbook.

"You want to put out a TV show? If you have the money to do it on your own, by yourself, and you have a TV network, you can do it by yourself. But the nature of the beast is, art needs finance.

"Humanity's legacy of stories and storytelling is the most precious we have. All wisdom is in our stories and songs. A story is how we construct our experiences. At the very simplest, it can be: 'He/she was born, lived, died.' Probably that is the template of our stories - a beginning, middle, and end. This structure is in our minds.","Doris Lessing","Wisdom,Humanity,Legacy,End"

"What works for men does not always work for women, because success and likability are positively correlated for men and negatively correlated for women. That's what the research shows. As a man gets more successful, everyone is rooting for him. As a woman gets more successful, both men and women like her less.","Sheryl Sandberg","Success,Work,Women,Man"

"It's not a failure if a marriage or partnership ends after a certain number of years. I think, in general, we expect too much of partners. We can't fulfil a person's every single need and, after ten years or so, many relationships wear out. If we were more philosophical about it, we wouldn't try to blame the other person or be bitter.","Deborah Moggach","Failure,Marriage,Blame,Partnership"
"Who will tell whether one happy moment of love or the joy of breathing or walking on a bright morning and smelling the fresh air, is not worth all the suffering and effort which life implies.","Erich Fromm","Life,Love,Morning,Happy"
"I basically see two reasons for a going public: Glencore gets access to more money. It is a way of funding your business and to finance growth. Plus: You have more liquid shares. It is easier to leave the company and redeem your shares. The 'going public' may also be an exit strategy for the top management.","Marc Rich","Finance,Business,Money,Growth"

"I tell my students, it's not difficult to identify with somebody like yourself, somebody next door who looks like you. What's more difficult is to identify with someone you don't see, who's very far away, who's a different color, who eats a different kind of food. When you begin to do that then literature is really performing its wonders.","Chinua Achebe","Food,Door,Color,Yourself"
"I was not thinking about infinite multipliers when I was 10. But I did have a father who was a Ph.D. in commerce and finance and an intellectual man.

It wasn't dramatic; it was just depressing.","Moby","Failure,Time,People,Remember"

"Both old and young alike ought to seek wisdom: the former in order that, as age comes over him, he may be young in good things because of the grace of what has been, and the latter in order that, while he is young, he may at the same time be old, because he has no fear of the things which are to come.","Epicurus","Wisdom,Time,Age,Fear"

"You look at marketing: everything that's happening in marketing is digitized. Everything that's happening in finance is digitized.

"Success is a terrible thing and a wonderful thing. If you can enjoy it, it's wonderful. If it starts eating away at you, and they're waiting for more from me, or what can I do to top this, then you're in trouble. Just do what you love. That's all I want to do.","Gene Wilder","Success,Love,Waiting"

"I don't think it ever does any harm in any business to feel that there is someone there who cares about it. If you look at any business, fashion being the most obvious, the aura, or the reality of the designer, is part of what creates it. It's true in luxury goods stores and in good food stores. It leaves a palpable sense that someone cares.","Andre Balazs","Food,Business,Good,Good Food"

"I think people are very stiff. Money makes people stiff, and we want it, and we have to pay the penalty. I never agreed with stiffness. I think people have an understanding of what their life is.

"The quality, not the longevity, of one's life is what is important.","Martin Luther King, Jr.","Life,Quality,Important"

"Cynicism masquerades as wisdom, but it is the furthest thing from it. Because cynics don't learn anything.
